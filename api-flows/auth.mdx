# Point of Service API Authentication Flow

The Point of Service (POS) API admin panel uses Basic authentication and the OAuth Resource Owner Password Credentials (ROPC) Flow.

To provide the proper experience for admins using the POS admin panel, you'll need to provide the following capabilities: 

1. Create an account
2. Log in to the admin panel
3. Refresh an account's access token

## Step 1: Create account

The user will first create their account for the POS admin client app.

### Request

The client sends an HTTP request to the `/users` endpoint, including the `user_name`, `password`, and `grant_type` properties in the request body.

**Endpoint**: `POST /users`

```curl
curl -X 'POST' \
  'https://reimagined-journey-g45xxv4v6gwhvrrr-80.app.github.dev/users' \
  -H 'accept: application/json' \
  -H 'Authorization: Basic {basicAuthToken}' \
  -H 'content-type: application/json' \
  -d '{
    "grant_type": "password",
    "user_name": "my-user-name",
    "password": "my-secure-password"
  }'
```

### Response

If the request was successful, the server responds with a `201 Created` status code with the response body containing the new user account resource.


## Step 2: Log in as the admin

Admin users will log into the admin portal to perform actions like creating users and dishes or adding/updating ingredients. To send requests to admin endpoints, the client app requires an access token which is obtained by making a POST call to the `/auth/token` endpoint.

### Request

The client sends an HTTP request that includes a basic authorization header and the user's `user_name` and `password`.

**Endpoint**: `POST /auth/token`

```curl
curl -X 'POST' \
  'https://reimagined-journey-g45xxv4v6gwhvrrr-80.app.github.dev/auth/token' \
  -H 'accept: application/json' \
  -H 'Authorization: Basic {base64EncodedclientidclientSecret}' \
  -H 'content-type: application/json' \
  -d '{
    "grant_type": "password",
    "user_name": "my-user-name",
    "password": "my-secure-password"
  }'
```

### Response

If the request was successful, the server responds with a `201 Created` status code with an access token in the response body.

Response body properties:

| Property   | Type  | Description            |
| --------   | ----- | ---------------------- |
| `access_token` | string | The UUID used for authentication, required for accessing protected endpoints |
| `expires_in` | integer | The time, in seconds, the access token remains valid | 
| `refresh_token` | string | The value of the refresh token, used to obtain the new access token after it expires |
| `token_type` | string | The type of access token, which will always be `Bearer` |

## Step 3: Refresh the access token

After the `access_token` expires, you can refresh the access token by sending a POST call to the `/auth/refresh-token` endpoint.

### Request

The client sends an HTTP request using the `refresh_token` value in the authorization header.

**Endpoint**: `POST /auth/refresh-token`

```curl
curl -X 'POST' \
  'https://reimagined-journey-g45xxv4v6gwhvrrr-80.app.github.dev/auth/refresh-token' \
  -H 'accept: application/json' \
  -H 'Authorization: Bearer {refreshToken}' \
  -d ''
```

### Response

If the request was successful, the server responds with a `201 Created` status code with the response body containing the new access and refresh tokens.
