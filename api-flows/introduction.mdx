# About the Point of Service API Guides

The "API Flows" pages are developer guides I wrote as part of the Mastering API Documentation course, taught by Mark Wentowksi of [Docs Geek](https://docsgeek.bigcartel.com/). This course used the Point of Service API as an example API to teach developer documentation practices. 

The guides document common user flows that developers would need to understand to properly leverage the course's example API. 

The example API simulated a series of endpoints that could be leveraged for a restaurant order management client application. These guides and the related [API reference documentation](/pos-reference/introduction) are the result of my work on the course projects.
