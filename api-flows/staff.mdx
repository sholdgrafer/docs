# Point of Sale Staff API Flow

To provide the proper experience to staff using the Point of Sale (POS) API, you'll need to build the following capabilities:

1. View orders
2. Prioritize orders
3. Initiate order preparation
4. View order prep by stations
5. View dish ingredients
6. Ready the order for assembly
7. Assemble the order

## Step 1: View orders

When a staff member is ready to view the orders in the queue, they'll click **Orders** in the side navigation. The orders display should include ten orders per page and be sorted by the `created_at` field so the newest order displays first.

### Request

The client sends an HTTP request to retreive the list of orders.

```curl

```


### Response

If the request was successful, the server responds with a `200 okay` status code with the response body containing the following properties:

| Property     | Type    |  Description      |
| ------------ | ------- | ----------------- |
|   |   |
