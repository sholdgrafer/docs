# About the Point of Service API Reference Documentation

The Point of Service example API simulates a series of endpoints that could be leveraged for a restaurant order management client application. 

This API reference documentation and the related [developer guides](/api-flows/introduction) are the result of my work on the Mastering API Documentation course projects.
